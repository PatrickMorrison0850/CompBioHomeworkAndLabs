The main objective of this lab was to determine how to parse data.
The first thing to happen was the dates and times were converted into seconds and then minutes, with the "clock" starting at the time 
that the first camera trap went off.  The second way in which the data was modified was where a function was written that could
calulate the difference in time between any two points
The final way the data was manipulated was a function was written that if given a species, placement, station and season, 
the function would find the total number of trappings with the specified criteria and would return a vector with 
the time intervals between the trappings.
