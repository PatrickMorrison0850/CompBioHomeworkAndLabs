Question #4 
* A The Purpose of this study was to map the global chlorophyll signature in the worlds oceans to determine how acccurate modern models are at determing the distribution of photosynthesis in the worlds oceans
* B The SeaWIFS satellite was used to spectrographically determine the surface concentration of chlorophyll 
* C
** 1 The data was stored in a matlab two dimensional data format
** 2 The size of the data is 6.46 mega bytes
Question #5 
>What I hope to do with the data is determine how much proximity to the coast determines the rates at which photosynthesis takes place
In the open oceans, there is what's known as high nutrient, low chlorophyll concentrations.  These are regions of the ocean where there 
is a high concentration of nitrogen and phosphorus but with low concentrations of chlorophyll.  It is believed that in these 
regions iron is limiting.  Evidence suggests that Fe is input from the continents from rivers and dust, resulting in a higher 
concentrations of iron in the coastal seas and higher production.  The purpose of this analysis is to determine how proximity to the
coast will impact chlorophyll concentrations.  This will be compared to upwelling regions and how they influence chlorophyll 
concentrations.  Using matlabs inbuilt data detailing where the coast is, the distance from the coast of each data point will be
calculated to establish a relationship between chlorophyll concentration and distance from the coast.  This will be repeated but 
instead of the proximity to the coast, the proximity of each point to upwelling latitudes will be determined.  The two resulting 
data sets will be compared to determine how proximity to the coast influences productivity.
