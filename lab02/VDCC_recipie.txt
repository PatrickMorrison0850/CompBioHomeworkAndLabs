Wet ingredients:
	1 tablespoon ground flax mixed with 3 tablespoons water
	1/4 cup virgin coconut oil (do not melt)
	1/4 cup sunflower seed butter (see note)
	1/3 cup unpacked brown sugar
	1/3 cup natural cane sugar
	1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Dry Ingredients:
	1/2 teaspoon baking soda
	1/2 teaspoon baking powder
	1/2 teaspoon fine grain sea salt
	3 tablespoons cocoa powder
	1.5 cups gluten-free rolled oats, processed into flour (or 1.5 cups oat flour)
	1-2 teaspoons non-dairy milk (only if needed to moisten batter)
	100 grams finely chopped dark chocolate (1 chocolate bar)

Directions:
	1. Preheat oven to 350F and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. 
	2. In a large mixing bowl, mix together the flax and water and set aside for a few minutes so it can thicken up. 
	3. Whisk the flax egg again once thickened.
	4. Add the rest of the wet ingredients into the bowl with the flax egg (coconut oil, sunflower seed butter, brown sugar, cane sugar, and vanilla). With a hand-held electric mixer, beat the ingredients until combined and smooth.
	5. Now, beat in the dry ingredients, one by one, as you go down the ingredient list (baking soda, baking powder, salt, cocoa powder, oat flour). If your dough is a bit dry, add a teaspoon (or two) of non-dairy milk and beat the mixture again. The dough should be moist enough to form balls without cracking, but not super sticky.
	6. Chop the chocolate (it should be the size of peas). 
	7. Beat the chocolate into the batter or simply stir by hand.
	8. Shape balls of dough (about the size of a golf ball or 2 heaping tablespoons) and place on the baking sheet 2-3 inches apart. Gently press down on each ball with your hand to form a disc (it should be 1/2-inch thick or so).
	9. Bake for about 12-13 minutes (I baked for 13 mins) until the cookies are spread out nicely.
C	10. Cool cookies on the baking sheet for 7 minutes or so and then transfer to a cooling rack for another 10-15 minutes.
